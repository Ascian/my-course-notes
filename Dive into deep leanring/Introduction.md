# introduction

## key components

* the data we can learn from
* the model of how to transform the data
* an objective function(loss function) that qualifies how well the model is doing
* an algorithm to adjust the model's parameter to optimize the objective function

## kinds of machine learning problems

## supervised learning

Supervised learning describes tasks where we are given a dataset containing both features and labels and tasked with producing a model to predict the labels given input features.
